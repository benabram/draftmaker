# Incident Report: Batch Monitor Auto-Recovery Issue

**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

## Executive Summary
A critical issue was discovered where the batch monitor Cloud Function was automatically recovering batch jobs every 10 minutes, causing duplicate eBay listings to be created.

## Timeline
- **01:10 UTC**: Issue reported - batch jobs running unexpectedly and pushing listings to eBay
- **01:18 UTC**: Root cause identified - batch-health-monitor function marking jobs as failed and triggering recovery
- **01:21 UTC**: Batch monitor scheduler paused
- **01:22 UTC**: Batch monitor function and scheduler deleted
- **01:25 UTC**: Recovery endpoint removed from application
- **01:29 UTC**: Fix deployed to production

## Problem Description
The batch-health-monitor Cloud Function was designed to detect and recover "stuck" batch jobs. However, it was incorrectly identifying completed or normally running jobs as stuck and marking them for recovery every 10 minutes via Cloud Scheduler.

### Root Cause
1. The batch monitor checked job status every 10 minutes
2. It marked jobs as "failed" if they hadn't updated recently (within 10 minutes)
3. It then called the recovery endpoint to restart these jobs
4. This caused already-processed UPCs to be reprocessed and duplicate listings to be created on eBay

## Impact
- Multiple duplicate eBay listings were created
- Batch jobs that were already completed were being re-run
- System resources were wasted on unnecessary reprocessing

## Resolution
### Immediate Actions Taken
1. **Paused Cloud Scheduler**: Immediately stopped the batch-monitor-scheduler job
2. **Deleted Monitor Function**: Removed the batch-health-monitor Cloud Function completely
3. **Removed Recovery Endpoint**: Deleted the `/api/batch/recover/{job_id}` endpoint from app.py
4. **Stopped Running Jobs**: Marked all currently running batch jobs as failed with explanation
5. **Deployed Fix**: Pushed updated code to production without recovery capabilities

### Code Changes
- Deleted: `functions/batch_monitor/main.py`
- Deleted: `scripts/deploy-batch-monitor.sh`
- Modified: `app.py` - removed recovery endpoint and MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS constant
- Stopped: 6 batch jobs that were incorrectly marked as running

## Verification
- Confirmed recovery endpoint returns 404: `curl -X POST .../api/batch/recover/test` â†’ 404
- Confirmed no new recovery attempts in logs
- Confirmed batch monitor scheduler no longer exists
- Confirmed batch monitor function no longer exists

## Lessons Learned
1. **Auto-recovery is dangerous**: Automatic job recovery without proper validation can cause duplicate processing
2. **Health checks need context**: Simple timeout-based health checks don't account for legitimate long-running processes
3. **Idempotency is critical**: Batch processing systems must be idempotent to prevent duplicate side effects

## Prevention Measures
### Short-term
- Recovery functionality completely removed
- Manual intervention now required for any stuck jobs

### Recommended Long-term Improvements
1. **Implement idempotent processing**: Check if a UPC has already been processed before creating listings
2. **Add job status validation**: Never recover a job marked as "completed"
3. **Use distributed locks**: Prevent multiple instances from processing the same job
4. **Add duplicate detection**: Check for existing eBay listings before creating new ones
5. **Implement proper heartbeats**: Use actual heartbeat mechanisms rather than update timestamps
6. **Add recovery safeguards**: If recovery is re-implemented, add checks for:
   - Job completion status
   - Recent successful checkpoints
   - Maximum retry limits per UPC
   - Duplicate listing detection

## Follow-up Actions Required
1. Review and remove any duplicate eBay listings created during the incident
2. Audit all batch jobs in Firestore to ensure correct status
3. Consider implementing a manual recovery process with proper safeguards
4. Add monitoring alerts for unexpected batch job executions
